Dramatic changes such as the slow death of Twitter and the rapid rise of generative artificial intelligence are fundamentally reshaping the platforms on which we create, communicate, and publish. Panelists imagine possible futures of born-digital literature, considering tools of resistance, including feminist and queer approaches to code, "small" language models, mixed and virtual reality, and alternatives to corporate-owned platforms.

## Abstracts

The history of electronic literature is punctuated with amazing moments where we see writers and artists and theorists building the tools they need, influencing technology development and inspiring the creation of expressive authoring tools and platforms responsive to visions of what a text can be and do. Mostly underfunded, standalone and generally outside of networked environments – Storyspace, SnapdragonAr, and Korsakow, for example– experimental software responsive to the needs of the work itself and to visions of future elit is an important story to tell and one that can help us to imagine opportunities and platforms for elit’s future.  The future, like the past, will see a proliferation of tools, both bespoke and corporate.  And, as in the past, the success of future forms and platforms outside corporate software platforms will have a lot to do with the capacity to build audiences for our work in the near-term and the capacity to preserve and archive over the longterm.  Working on corporate platforms challenges us to connect with built-in audiences for as long as the platform exists. It can be experienced as an exciting, creative constraint. Working outside mainstream, networked, environments requires us to build audiences and a user base for our tools mostly from scratch and requires us nurture new literacies. We lose things. But this talk will focus on what we might gain.

**A Cyborg Creative Coding Practice**

This brief talk will use Donna Haraway’s concept of the cyborg to discuss my creative coding practice, particularly to produce code engines for electronic literature and other forms of digital writing. In this workflow, I iteratively prompt Chat GPT to generate valid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and modify the resulting output in a code editor to create unique works of electronic literature and digital writing. This practice is an example of Cyborg writing because it integrates human and artificial intelligence to produce code writing that results in electronic literature. I will showcase some of the work I have done to rescue now-inoperable Twitter bots created using Kate Compton’s Tracery JavaScript library, as well as some recent works published in Taper and The Los Angeles Review. The goal is to show how to leverage and subvert black box large language model generators to create open source small language models for computer generated writing.

**The Future of Writing with XR Enhanced by AI**

Current commercial efforts for XR development have focused, for the most part, on
entertainment and social experiences. In regard to the latter, hosting meetings,
performing architecture and engineering tasks where a 3D representation of the work is
clear and valuable, and engaging in specific work tasks, such as interacting with large
knowledge graphs, remain the main areas of use. Even the recent release of the Apple
Vision Pro has shown little software development aimed to change the direction of use
and open up the possibilities of this powerful tool for writing and creating.
This paper discusses the project undertaken by the presenter, entitled “The Future of
Text in XR,” funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, that is building open-source XR
software for writing. It includes the work the team is planning for integrating AI for
enhancing the environment, making it possible to access multiple documents from a
library in an environment, add notations to and link those documents, and create new
documents from them.

As the heart of our project is the belief that a fundamental change will occur when
working in XR with AI, together, becomes the norm because when we see different and
we can interact differently––as certainly working in a 3D environment allows––we
become different. Our concern is that the paradigms of working with these technologies
will be owned or controlled solely by commercial entities that have their own priorities.
Therefore, our goal is to inspire and enable powerfully useful workspaces and workflows
for academic and creative use.

**Down and Out Online: Queer E-Literary Collectives Across Precarious Platforms**

The phrase “Down and Out” primarily connotes the unlucky lot of those downtrodden and outcast at the margins of society. That would certainly apply online to queer creative communities scattered by the repeated collapses of social media services once trusted for the sense of virtual solidarity they fostered. But I am further interested here in “down” as slang for willing and “out” as in openly queer, other competing meanings for these words that describe the inventional resilience of queer coalition building across precarious platforms. In the tension of these dual definitions, I consider “Down and Out Online” to describe how what I call queer e-literary collectives pop up outside of corporate versions of social media on sites more geared toward art and their fandoms, such as itch.io. Where platforms like Tumblr and formerly Twitter failed to protect the features that made them viable commons for queer content creators, itch.io persists as a space where users connect over electronic literature, not just through collection and curation but also through opportunities of creation at regular game jams. I have formerly referred to itch.io as a Folk ELC (Electronic Literature Collection), and here I explore its capacity for folklore as connective tissue that queer e-literary collectives build shared culture out of. Queer creators and the communities that form around their content are down and out online in every sense, making art at the margins and forging a sense of belonging through them that lasts where platforms may not.

**Tiny, Bespoke, and Off-Grid: Computational Poetics and Language Models that are not Large**

The acceleration of generative AI technology in recent years is often conveyed in a rhetorical move that uses the size of the language model as a proxy for its capabilities. While GPT-3’s reported 172 billion parameters (trained on 500 billion tokens) made it the largest publicly available generative AI service at the time of its release in 2020, successive products have only gotten larger. And yet, as Bender, Gebru, “Schmitchell,” and McMillan-Major argue in their oft-cited paper, “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots,” bigger is not better. In this brief talk, I will discuss computational poetry generators that leverage small, custom language models in ways that implicitly or explicitly critique mainstream generative AI for its environmental impact, its hegemonic bias, and its reliance on exegetical fallacies. Creative text generators by Allison Parrish, Lillian-Yvonne Bertram, and Nick Montfort, respectively, each provide alternatives that operationally echo the critiques first made clear in the “Stochastic Parrots” paper. Furthermore, online literary magazines and small press book publishers, in keeping with the legacy of avant-garde and radical publishing traditions, are ideal platforms for disseminating this kind of creative-critical poetry. I argue that these platforms and the works they publish provide illuminating alternatives that are increasingly urgent as generative AI services become more deeply and problematically embedded in our creative workflows.
